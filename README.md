# Lactation QI

Globally, there is a paucity of data outlining how human milk and breastfeeding is supported in the NICU. In particular, it is unclear how many mothers of NICU babies are supported to build an adequate milk supply to allow long-term exclusive breastfeeding and subsequently whether NICU infants receive an optimal ‘dose’ of their own mother’s milk. In addition, there is limited data detailing whether there is sufficient implementation of practices known to support transition to at-breast feeding and the resultant long-term exclusive breastfeeding outcomes for this specific population.
